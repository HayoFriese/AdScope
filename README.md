# AdScope
Adscope was an experimental productivity system which was meant to provide a platform to generate precise invoices through the use of productivity tools available in the system, targetted towards advertising media agencies.

The application was a prototype, and makes use of jquery and php as the primary elements of functionality. My focus for the assignment was specifically UX design, so my focus was not on the code used for the system, much to my regret. The platform will need to be adapted to laravel and VueJS or React to better structure the software in all manners.

This project was part of my university dissertation.
